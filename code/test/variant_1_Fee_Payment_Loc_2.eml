Description: Request for Adjustment – Line of Credit Fee


Dear Summit Trust Customer Support,

I have been a customer with [Bank Name] for the past 5 years, and I recently noticed a Line of Credit Fee of $128 applied to my account. Given my long-standing relationship, I would like to request:

A possible reduction or waiver of this fee.

Any available promotions or benefits that might apply.

Please let me know if you require any additional details.


With Regards,
Emma Watson
