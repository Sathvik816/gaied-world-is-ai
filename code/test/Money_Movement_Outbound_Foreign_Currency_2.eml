Dear Kishkinda Bank Customer Support,

I am planning to make an outbound transfer in foreign currency and would like to confirm the current exchange rates. The details are:

From Currency: USD

To Currency: GBP (British Pound)

Amount: $20,000 USD

Expected Transfer Date: March 30, 2025

Please provide the real-time exchange rate and any applicable fees before proceeding with the transaction. Additionally, let me know if there is an option to lock in the exchange rate to avoid fluctuations.

Looking forward to your response.


With Regards,
Adidas
