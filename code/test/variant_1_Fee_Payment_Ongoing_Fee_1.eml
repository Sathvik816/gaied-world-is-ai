Description: Clarification on Ongoing Fee Charges – Account #123456


Dear Himalaya Bank Customer Support,

I noticed an ongoing fee of $32 deducted from my account this month. Could you please provide a detailed breakdown of this fee?

Additionally, I would like to confirm:

If there are any changes to my ongoing fee structure.

If I qualify for any fee waivers or discounts.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

With Regards,
Olivia Wilson
