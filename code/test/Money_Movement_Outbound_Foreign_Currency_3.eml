Dear Himalaya Bank Customer Support,

I recently initiated an outbound foreign currency transfer, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I would like to cancel the transaction. The details are:

Transaction ID: TRX123456

Amount: â‚¬12,000 EUR

Recipient Bank: HSBC France

IBAN: FR7630004000031234567890143

Transfer Date: March 22, 2025

Please confirm whether the transaction can still be reversed and if there are any cancellation fees. Let me know the necessary steps to proceed.


With Regards,
customer1
