Description: Request to Cancel Ongoing Fees


Dear Summit Trust Customer Support,

I am currently being charged a monthly ongoing fee of $40 for my account. I would like to request the cancellation of this fee as I no longer require the associated services.

Please confirm once this fee has been removed from my account.


With Regards,
Olivia Wilson
