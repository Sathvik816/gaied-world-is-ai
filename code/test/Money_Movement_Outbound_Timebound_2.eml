I scheduled an outbound transfer on March 25, 2025, but I have not received confirmation that it has been processed. The details are as follows:

Transaction ID: TRX789654

Amount: $5,000

Recipient Bank: XYZ Bank

Expected Processing Date: March 25, 2025

Status: Pending

Can you please provide an update on the status of this transfer? This payment is time-sensitive, and I need it to be completed as soon as possible.

Looking forward to your prompt response.


With Regards,
