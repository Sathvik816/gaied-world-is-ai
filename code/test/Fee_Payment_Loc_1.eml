Dear Himalaya Bank Customer Support,

 noticed a Line of Credit Fee of $200 charged to my account. I would like to clarify:

The exact reason for this charge.

Whether this fee is one-time or recurring.

If there are any options to reduce or waive this fee.

Please provide a response at your earliest convenience


With Regards,
