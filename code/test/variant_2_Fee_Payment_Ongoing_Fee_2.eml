Description: Dispute – Incorrect Ongoing Fee Deduction


Dear Himalaya Bank Customer Support,

I recently noticed an unauthorized ongoing fee of $67 deducted from my account on March 1, 2025. Based on my agreement, I should not be charged this fee.

Please review my account and process a refund if this charge was made in error. I have attached my previous statements for reference.

Looking forward to your resolution


With Regards,
David Miller
