## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction
This project extracts content from EML files and classifies emails based on their extracted content. It utilizes a pre-trained Generative AI model for zero-shot and few-shot classification, with plans to fine-tune a loan-specific model.

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project seems to be solving real-world email classification challenges, particularly in domains like loan service requests. Key motivations include:
Automating Email Processing
GenAI for Intelligent Classification
Fine-tuning for Domain-Specific Accuracy
Deployment as an API

## What it does
- Extracts email content from EML files
- Applies zero-shot and few-shot classification
- Supports fine-tuning for loan-specific email classification
- Deployable as an API

## How we built it
EML File Processing Module â†’ Extracts content from emails.
GenAI Classification Module â†’ Uses LLMs for email categorization.
API Deployment Module â†’ Serves the classification results via an API.

## Challenges We Faced
Identify the appropriate model for classification
Training the model
Utilize free tools and resources to implement the solution

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Google Colab (recommended for execution)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## How to checkout
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Upload your EML files to the working directory.

## How to Run
### Running in Google Colab
1. Upload the Colab notebook (`EML_Classification.ipynb`).
2. Upload your EML files to Colab's working directory.
3. Run all cells sequentially.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets
- Improve accuracy with prompt engineering
- Deploy as a REST API

## Tech Stack
